# House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning 

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts house prices based on various features such as size, location, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and other relevant factors. The goal is to provide a tool that can help buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals make informed decisions regarding property transactions.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, encode categorical features, and scale numerical features to prepare the dataset for modeling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize data to identify trends and relationships between features and house prices.
- **Feature Engineering:** Create new features and transform existing ones to enhance model performance.
- **Model Training:** Train various machine learning models including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
- **Model Evaluation:** Use metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (RÂ²) score to evaluate model performance.
- **Model Deployment:** Deploy the trained model using a web framework to provide a user-friendly interface for predicting house prices.

## Data
The dataset used in this project is a comprehensive collection of house listings, containing features like:
- `size`: The square footage of the house.
- `location`: The geographical location of the house.
- `bedrooms`: The number of bedrooms.
- `bathrooms`: The number of bathrooms.
- `amenities`: Additional features such as a swimming pool, garden, etc.
- `price`: The sale price of the house (target variable).

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection:** Gathered data from real estate listings and public datasets.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and prepared the data for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Used visualizations to understand the data and identify key trends.
4. **Feature Engineering:** Enhanced the dataset with new features and transformations.
5. **Model Training and Evaluation:** Trained multiple models and selected the best-performing one based on evaluation metrics.
6. **Model Deployment:** Deployed the final model using Flask to create a web-based prediction tool.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction.git
    cd house-price-prediction
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the application:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

## Usage
- Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your web browser.
- Enter the features of the house you want to predict the price for.
- Click the "Predict" button to get the estimated house price.
